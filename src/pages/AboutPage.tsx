        Hi! I like making things. I'm a developer and designer with a background
        in pure math and an obsession with constantly learning and improving my
        skills. Developing intuitive and appealing user experiences is what I'm
        all about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out the projects tab for examples of my work and feel free to
        contact me if you're interested in working together. I'm always excited
        to take on new challenges.
