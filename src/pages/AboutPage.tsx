        Helping businesses and organizations grow with modern, easy-to-use
        websites and apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love turning ideas into polished, practical tools. Whether it's a
        simple website, a custom app, or improving an existing online presence,
        I focus on creating experiences that feel effortless for your customers
        and clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a background in mathematics and years of hands-on development, I
        bring both problem-solving and design thinking to every project. The
        result: websites and applications that look great, run fast, and help
        you do business more effectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take a look at my projects for examples of past work, and get in touch
        if you'd like to explore how we can make your digital presence work
        harder for you.
