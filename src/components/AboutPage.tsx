        Hi!
        I like making things.
        I'm a developer and designer with a background in pure mathematics and an obsession with constantly learning and improving my skills.
        Developing intuitive and appealing user experiences is what I'm all about.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out the projects tab for examples of my work and feel free to contact me if you're interested in working together.
        I'm always excited to take on new challenges.
      </p>
